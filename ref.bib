Accounting for the lensing effect will be crucial to obtain accurate parameter constraints from sensitive CMB observations. Methods for computing the lensed power spectra using a low-order perturbative expansion are not good enough for percent-level accuracy. Non-perturbative flat-sky methods are more accurate, but curvature effects change the spectra at the 0.3-1\% level. We describe a new, accurate and fast, full-sky correlation-function method for computing the lensing effect on CMB power spectra to better than 0.1\% at l{\textless}2500 (within the approximation that the lensing potential is linear and Gaussian). We also discuss the effect of non-linear evolution of the gravitational potential on the lensed power spectra. Our fast numerical code is publicly available.},

As instrumental sensitivity improves, the limiting factor will eventually be B-mode power generated by gravitational lensing, which can be removed through use of so-called delensing algorithms. We forecast prospects for delensing using lensing maps which are obtained externally to CMB polarization: either from large-scale structure observations, or from high-resolution maps of CMB temperature. We conclude that the forecasts in either case are not encouraging, and that significantly delensing large-scale CMB polarization requires high-resolution polarization maps with sufficient sensitivity to measure the lensing B-mode. We also present a simple formalism for including delensing in CMB forecasts which is computationally fast and agrees well with Monte Carlos.},

We then describe the geometric decomposition of the CMB polarization pattern into a curl-free component (E mode) and curl component (B mode) and show explicitly that gravitational waves induce B modes. We discuss the B modes induced by gravitational lensing and by Galactic foregrounds and show how both are distinguished from those induced by inflationary gravitational waves.

This approach is equivalent at lowest order in scattering kinematics to classical radiative transfer, and provides a general framework for treating the cosmological evolution of density matrices. The metric perturbations are treated in the physically appealing longitudinal gauge. Expressions for various temperature and polarization correlation functions are derived.

These in turn correspond directly to the fundamental scalar (compressional), vector (vortical), and tensor (gravitational wave) modes of cosmological perturbations. We explain the origin and phenomenology of the geometric distinction between these patterns in terms of the so-called electric and magnetic parity modes, as well as their correlation with the temperature pattern. By its isolation of the last scattering surface and the various perturbation modes, the polarization provides unique information for the phenomenological reconstruction of the cosmological model.

	abstract = {We present a new method for calculating linear cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy spectra based on integration over sources along the photon past light cone. In this approach the temperature anisotropy is written as a time integral over the product of a geometrical term and a source term. The geometrical term is given by radial eigenfunctions which do not depend on the particular cosmological model. The source term can be expressed in terms of photon, baryon and metric perturbations, all of which can be calculated using a small number of differential equations. This split clearly separates between the dynamical and geometrical effects on the CMB anisotropies. More importantly, it allows to significantly reduce the computational time compared to standard methods. This is achieved because the source term, which depends on the model and is generally the most time consuming part of calculation, is a slowly varying function of wavelength and needs to be evaluated only in a small number of points. The geometrical term, which oscillates much more rapidly than the source term, does not depend on the particular model and can be precomputed in advance. Standard methods that do not separate the two terms and require a much higher number of evaluations. The new method leads to about two orders of magnitude reduction in CPU time when compared to standard methods and typically requires a few minutes on a workstation for a single model. The method should be especially useful for accurate determinations of cosmological parameters from CMB anisotropy and polarization measurements that will become possible with the next generation of experiments. A programm implementing this method can be obtained from the authors.},

	abstract = {Polarization induced by cosmological scalar perturbations leads to a typical anisotropy pattern, which can best be analyzed in Fourier domain. This allows one to unambiguously distinguish cosmological signal of polarization from other foregrounds and systematics, as well as from polarization induced by non-scalar perturbations. The precision with which polarization and cross-correlation power spectra can be determined is limited by cosmic variance, noise and foreground residuals. Choice of estimator can significantly improve our capability of extracting cosmological signal and in the noise dominated limit the optimal power spectrum estimator reduces the variance by a factor of two compared to the simplest estimator. If foreground residuals are important then a different estimator can be used, which eliminates systematic effects from foregrounds so that no further foreground subtraction is needed. A particular combination of Stokes \$Q\$ and \$U\$ parameters vanishes for scalar induced polarization, thereby allowing an unambiguous determination of tensor modes. Theoretical predictions of polarization in standard models show that one typically expects a signal at the level of 5-10\${\textbackslash}mu\$K on small angular scales and around 1\${\textbackslash}mu\$K on large scales (\$l{\textless}200\$). Satellite missions should be able to reach sensitivities needed for an unambiguous detection of polarization, which would help to break the degeneracies in the determination of some of the cosmological parameters.},

The formalism is an extension to the polarized case of the analytic approach recently developed by Hu and Sugiyama to evaluate the (unpolarized) temperature correlation function. The analytic approach helps to highlight the dependence of potentially measurable polarization properties of the cosmic microwave background radiation upon various parameters of the cosmological model. We show, for instance, that the ratio between the multipoles of the temperature and polarization correlation functions depends very sensitively upon the value of \${\textbackslash}Omega\_0\$, the matter density in units of the critical, in an open universe.},

Because acoustic peaks in polarization spectra are narrower than in the temperature spectrum the smoothing effect is significantly larger and can reach up to 10{\textbackslash}\% for \$l{\textless}1000\$ and even more above that. A qualitatively new feature is the generation of \$B\$ type polarization even when only \$E\$ is intrinsically present, such as in the case of pure scalar perturbations. This may be directly observed with Planck and other future small scale polarization experiments. The gravitational lensing effect is incorporated in the new version (2.4) of CMBFAST code.},

	abstract = {We probe the self-interactions of dark matter using observational data of relaxed galaxy groups and clusters. Our analysis uses the Jeans formalism and considers a wider range of systematic effects than in previous work, including adiabatic contraction and stellar anisotropy, to robustly constrain the self-interaction cross section. For both groups and clusters, our results show a mild preference for a nonzero cross section compared with cold collisionless dark matter. Our groups result, \${\textbackslash}sigma/m=0.5{\textbackslash}pm0.2{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm\}{\textasciicircum}2/{\textbackslash}mathrm\{g\}\$, places the first constraint on self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) at an intermediate scale between galaxies and massive clusters. Our clusters result is \${\textbackslash}sigma/m=0.19{\textbackslash}pm0.09{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm\}{\textasciicircum}2/{\textbackslash}mathrm\{g\}\$, with an upper limit of \${\textbackslash}sigma / m {\textless} 0.35{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm\}{\textasciicircum}2/{\textbackslash}mathrm\{g\}\$ (95\% CL). Thus, our results disfavor a velocity-independent cross section of order \$1{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm\}{\textasciicircum}2/{\textbackslash}mathrm\{g\}\$ or larger needed to address small scale structure problems in galaxies, but are consistent with a velocity-dependent cross section that decreases with increasing scattering velocity. Comparing the cross sections with and without the effect of adiabatic contraction, we find that adiabatic contraction produces slightly larger values for our data sample, but they are consistent at the \$1{\textbackslash}sigma\$ level. Finally, to validate our approach, we apply our Jeans analysis to a sample of mock data generated from SIDM-plus-baryons simulations with \${\textbackslash}sigma/m = 1{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm\}{\textasciicircum}2/{\textbackslash}mathrm\{g\}\$. This is the first test of the Jeans model at the level of stellar and lensing observables directly measured from simulations. We find our analysis gives a robust determination of the cross section, as well as consistently inferring the true baryon and dark matter density profiles.},

Exploiting a novel technique to increase the resolution of the dark matter calculation independently of that of the gas, the simulation resolves dark matter haloes and subhaloes of mass 5x10{\textasciicircum}6 Msun . It is therefore useful for studying the abundance and properties of the haloes and subhaloes targeted in strong lensing tests of the cold dark matter model. We estimate the halo and subhalo mass functions and discuss how they are affected both by the inclusion of baryons in the simulation and by the environment. We find that the halo and subhalo mass functions have lower amplitude in the hydrodynamical simulation than in its dark matter only counterpart. This reflects the reduced growth of haloes in the hydrodynamical simulation due to the early loss of gas by reionisation and galactic winds and, additionally, in the case of subhaloes, disruption by enhanced tidal effects within the host halo due to the presence of a massive central galaxy. The distribution of haloes is highly anisotropic reflecting the filamentary character of mass accretion onto the cluster. As a result, there is significant variation in the number of structures with viewing direction. The median number of structures near the centre of the halo, when viewed in projection, is reduced by a factor of two when baryons are included.},

Here we report a cosmological simulation of the formation of present-day haloes over the full range of observed halo masses (20 orders of magnitude) when dark matter is assumed to be in the form of weakly interacting massive particles of mass approximately 100 gigaelectronvolts. The simulation has a full dynamic range of 30 orders of magnitude in mass and resolves the internal structure of hundreds of Earth-mass haloes in as much detail as it does for hundreds of rich galaxy clusters. We find that halo density profiles are universal over the entire mass range and are well described by simple two-parameter fitting formulae. Halo mass and concentration are tightly related in a way that depends on cosmology and on the nature of the dark matter. For a fixed mass, the concentration is independent of the local environment for haloes less massive than those of typical galaxies. Haloes over the mass range of 10{\textasciicircum}3 to 10{\textasciicircum}11 solar masses contribute about equally (per logarithmic interval) to the luminosity produced by dark matter annihilation, which we find to be smaller than all previous estimates by factors ranging up to one thousand.},

and their Environments (EAGLE) project, a suite of hydrodynamical
simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and supermassive black
holes in cosmologically representative volumes of a standard Λ
cold dark matter universe. We discuss the limitations of such
simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained
subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major
improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and active
galactic nuclei (AGN) in which thermal energy is injected into the gas
without the need to turn off cooling or decouple hydrodynamical forces,
allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading
factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from
first principles, we calibrate them to the present-day galaxy stellar
mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass
relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy
stellar mass function is reproduced to ≲ 0.2 dex over the full
resolved mass range, 108 {\textless} M*/M⊙
≲ 1011, a level of agreement close to that attained by
semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations.
We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift
observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement
with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive
fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy
clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic C IV and O
VI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are
consistent with observations for M* ≳ 109
M⊙ (M* ≳ 1010
M⊙ at intermediate resolution), they are insufficiently
steep at lower masses. For the reference model, the gas fractions and
temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for galaxy
groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating
temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. The EAGLE
simulation suite, which also includes physics variations and higher
resolution zoomed-in volumes described elsewhere, constitutes a valuable
new resource for studies of galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {The Local Group galaxies offer some of the most discriminating tests of models of cosmic structure formation. For example, observations of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda satellite populations appear to be in disagreement with N-body simulations of the `lambda cold dark matter' (ΛCDM) model: there are far fewer satellite galaxies than
substructures in CDM haloes (the `missing satellites' problem); dwarf galaxies seem to avoid the most massive substructures (the
`too-big-to-fail' problem); and the brightest satellites appear to orbit their host galaxies on a thin plane (the `planes of satellites'
problem). Here we present results from APOSTLE (A Project Of Simulating The Local Environment), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of 12 volumes selected to match the kinematics of the Local Group (LG) members. Applying the EAGLE code to the LG environment, we find that our simulations match the observed abundance of LG galaxies, including the satellite galaxies of the MW and Andromeda. Due to changes to the structure of haloes and the evolution in the LG environment, the simulations reproduce the observed relation between stellar mass and velocity dispersion of individual dwarf spheroidal galaxies without necessitating the formation of cores in their dark matter profiles. Satellite systems form with a range of spatial anisotropies, including one similar to the MWs, confirming that such a configuration is not unexpected in ΛCDM. Finally, based on the observed velocity
dispersion, size, and stellar mass, we provide estimates of the maximum circular velocity for the haloes of nine MW dwarf spheroidals.},

	abstract = {The cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological model unambigously predicts that a large number of haloes should survive as subhaloes when they are accreted into a larger halo. The CDM model would be ruled out if such substructures were shown not to exist. By contrast, if the dark matter consists of warm particles (WDM), then below a threshold mass that depends on the particle mass far fewer substructures would be present. Finding subhaloes below a certain mass would then rule out warm particle masses below some value. Strong gravitational lensing provides a clean method to measure the subhalo mass function through distortions in the structure of Einstein rings and giant arcs.Using mock lensing observations constructed from high-resolution N-body simulations, we show that measurements of approximately 100 strong lens systems with a detection limit of \$10{\textasciicircum}7 h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ would clearly distinguish CDM from WDM in the case where this consists of 7 keV sterile neutrinos such as those that might be responsible for the 3.5 keV X-ray emission line recently detected in galaxies and clusters.},

For the power spectra, this approach not only simplifies the calculations but is also readily generalized from the usual flat-sky approximation to the exact all-sky form by replacing Fourier harmonics with spherical harmonics. Counterintuitively, due to the nonlinear nature of the effect, errors in the flat-sky approximation do not improve on smaller scales. They remain at the 10\% level through the acoustic regime and are sufficiently large to merit adoption of the all-sky formalism. For the bispectra, a cosmic variance limited detection of the correlation with secondary anisotropies has an order of magnitude greater signal-to-noise for combinations involving magnetic parity polarization than those involving the temperature alone. Detection of these bispectra will however be severely noise and foreground limited even with the Planck satellite, leaving room for improvement with higher sensitivity experiments. We also provide a general study of the correspondence between flat and all sky potentials, deflection angles, convergence and shear for the power spectra and bispectra.},

Polarization begins to assist in the reconstruction when E-mode mapping becomes possible on degree-scale fields, i.e. for an experiment with a noise level of {\textasciitilde}40 uK-arcmin and beam of {\textasciitilde}7', similar to the Planck experiment; surpasses the temperature reconstruction at {\textasciitilde}26 uK-arcmin and 4'; yet continues to improve the reconstruction until the lensing B-modes are mapped to l {\textasciitilde} 2000 at {\textasciitilde}0.3 uK-arcmin and 3'. Ultimately, the correlation between the E and B modes can provide a high signal-to-noise mass map out to multipoles of L {\textasciitilde} 1000, extending the range of temperature-based estimators by nearly an order of magnitude. We outline four applications of mass reconstruction: measurement of the linear power spectrum in projection to the cosmic variance limit out to L {\textasciitilde} 1000 (or wavenumbers 0.002 {\textless} k {\textless} 0.2 in h/Mpc), cross-correlation with cosmic shear surveys to probe the evolution of structure tomographically, cross-correlation of the mass and temperature maps to probe the dark energy, and the separation of lensing and gravitational wave B-modes.},

We focus on the prospects for using CMB measurements to differentiate various inflationary mechanisms. In particular, a detection of primordial B-mode polarization would demonstrate that inflation occurred at a very high energy scale, and that the inflaton traversed a super-Planckian distance in field space. We explain how such a detection or constraint would illuminate aspects of physics at the Planck scale. Moreover, CMB measurements can constrain the scale-dependence and non-Gaussianity of the primordial fluctuations and limit the possibility of a significant isocurvature contribution. Each such limit provides crucial information on the underlying inflationary dynamics. Finally, we quantify these considerations by presenting forecasts for the sensitivities of a future satellite experiment to the inflationary parameters.},

As the B-mode signal is probably dominated by foregrounds at all frequencies, the detection of the cosmological component depends drastically on our ability to remove foregrounds. We provide an analytical expression with which to estimate the level of the residual polarization for Galactic foregrounds, according to the method employed for their subtraction. We interpret this result in terms of the lower limit of the tensor-to-scalar ratio r that allows us to disentangle the cosmological B-mode polarization from the foreground contribution. Polarized emission from extragalactic radio sources and gravitational lensing is also taken into account. As a ﬁrst approach, we consider the ideal limit of an instrumental noise-free experiment: for full-sky coverage and a resolution of 1◦, we obtain a limit of r ∼ 10−4. This value can be improved by high-resolution experiments and, in principle, there is no clear fundamental limit on the detectability of the polarization of gravitational waves. Our analysis is also applied to planned or hypothetical future polarization experiments, taking into account expected noise levels.},

	abstract = {As confusion with lensing B-modes begins to limit experiments that search for primordial B-mode polarization, robust methods for delensing the CMB polarization sky are becoming increasingly important. We investigate in detail the possibility of delensing the CMB with the cosmic infrared background (CIB), emission from dusty star-forming galaxies that is an excellent tracer of the CMB lensing signal, in order to improve constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio \$r\$. We find that the maps of the CIB, such as current Planck satellite maps at 545 GHz, can be used to remove more than half of the lensing B-mode power. Calculating optimal combinations of different large-scale-structure tracers for delensing, we find that co-adding CIB data and external arcminute-resolution CMB lensing reconstruction can lead to significant additional improvements in delensing performance. We investigate whether measurement uncertainty in the CIB spectra will degrade the delensing performance if no model of the CIB spectra is assumed, and instead the CIB spectra are marginalized over, when constraining \$r\$. We find that such uncertainty does not significantly affect B-mode surveys smaller than a few thousand degrees. Even for larger surveys it causes only a moderate reduction in CIB delensing performance, especially if the surveys have high (arcminute) resolution, which allows self-calibration of the delensing procedure. Though further work on the impact of foreground residuals is required, our overall conclusions for delensing with current CIB data are optimistic: this delensing method can tighten constraints on \$r\$ by a factor up to \${\textbackslash}approx2.2\$, and by a factor up to \${\textbackslash}approx4\$ when combined with external \${\textbackslash}approx 3 {\textbackslash}mu\$K-arcmin lensing reconstruction, without requiring the modeling of CIB properties. CIB delensing is thus a promising method for the upcoming generation of CMB polarization surveys.},

In the framework of standard single-field inflationary models with Einstein gravity, these results imply that: (a) the predictions of slow-roll models with a concave potential, {\textless}i{\textgreater}V{\textless}i/{\textgreater}″({\textless}i{\textgreater}ϕ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) {\textless} 0, are increasingly favoured by the data; and (b) based on two different methods for reconstructing the inflaton potential, we find no evidence for dynamics beyond slow roll. Three different methods for the non-parametric reconstruction of the primordial power spectrum consistently confirm a pure power law in the range of comoving scales 0.005 Mpc{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} ≲ {\textless}i{\textgreater}k{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ≲ 0.2 Mpc{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. A complementary analysis also finds no evidence for theoretically motivated parameterized features in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} power spectra. For the case of oscillatory features that are logarithmic or linear in {\textless}i{\textgreater}k{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, this result is further strengthened by a new combined analysis including the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} bispectrum data. The new {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} polarization data provide a stringent test of the adiabaticity of the initial conditions for the cosmological fluctuations. In correlated, mixed adiabatic and isocurvature models, the non-adiabatic contribution to the observed CMB temperature variance is constrained to 1.3\%, 1.7\%, and 1.7\% at 95\% CL for cold dark matter, neutrino density, and neutrino velocity, respectively. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} power spectra plus lensing set constraints on the amplitude of compensated cold dark matter-baryon isocurvature perturbations that are consistent with current complementary measurements. The polarization data also provide improved constraints on inflationary models that predict a small statistically anisotropic quadupolar modulation of the primordial fluctuations. However, the polarization data do not support physical models for a scale-dependent dipolar modulation. All these findings support the key predictions of the standard single-field inflationary models, which will be further tested by future cosmological observations.},

We discuss the field's history, potential science and current status, contaminating foregrounds, detection and analysis techniques and future prospects. Throughout the review we draw comparisons to particle physics, a field that has many of the same goals and that has gone through many of the same stages.},
